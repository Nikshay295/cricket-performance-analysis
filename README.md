# Cricket Performance Analysis

## Objective
To predict the total runs scored by cricket players using batting-related statistics like matches, innings, averages, and milestones (centuries, half-centuries).

## Project Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis, correlation mapping, and distribution checks
- Built multiple linear regression models including interaction and polynomial terms
- Applied Ridge and Lasso regression for regularization and model tuning
- Compared performance across models using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²

## Technologies Used
- R, caret, ggplot2, glmnet, ggcorrplot, Metrics
- Polynomial regression, interaction terms, cross-validation
- Visualizations for EDA and residual diagnostics

## Files Included
- `cricket_performance_analysis.R`: Full source code
- `Cricket_Performance_Analysis_Report.docx`: Full written report
- `Cricket_Performance_Analysis_Presentation.pptx`: Project presentation slides
